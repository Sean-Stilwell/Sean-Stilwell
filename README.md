## About Me

I hold a masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Ottawa. My research focused on Natural Language Processing and Explainable AI (XAI). In my thesis, I applied XAI to a prompt learning system that I created for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. In my undergraduate capstone project, I created a named entity recognition model for legal texts.

I have over three years experience in the Government of Canada. My current role is an IT Analyst in Shared Services Canada, developing data solutions for government scientists. Previously, I've worked as a data scientist for the Canadian Space Agency, where I analyzed geospatial datasets and worked on their open data portal. I also have experience as a web developer and as a quality assurance analyst.

I am fluently bilingual at the CCC level on the Government of Canada Second Language Evaluation. I also hold the DELF B2 certification from the Ministry of Education of France and graduated with the French Immersion certificate at the University of Ottawa. I also have basic proficiency in German.
