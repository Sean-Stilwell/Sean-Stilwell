    <h1>Hi, I'm Sean (He/Him).</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student currently enrolled at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Ever since I first learned to code in High School, I've been passionate about software development. I have experience with numerous programming languages and technologies, and am always eager to learn new skills! I am proficient at Full Stack development and have developed two Android applications.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm fluently bilingual, having attained my DELF B2 certification from the Ministry of Education of France, as well as the Second Language Certification from the University of Ottawa. Bilingualism is important to me, I've helped promote French for clubs at uOttawa and uOttawa's French Immersion program for high school classes.</p>
